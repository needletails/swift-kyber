// This header primarily exists in order to make compiling against code that
// expects OpenSSL easier. We have merged this header into <openssl/x509.h>.
// However, due to conflicts, some deprecated symbols are defined here.
#include "CKyberBoringSSL_x509.h"


// CRL reason constants.

// TODO(davidben): These constants live here because strongswan defines
// conflicting symbols and has been relying on them only being defined in
// <openssl/x509v3.h>. Defining the constants in <openssl/x509.h> would break
// strongswan, but we would also like for new code to only need
// <openssl/x509.h>. Introduce properly namespaced versions of these constants
// and, separately, see if we can fix strongswan to similarly avoid the
// conflict. Between OpenSSL, strongswan, and wincrypt.h all defining these
// constants, it seems best for everyone to just avoid them going forward.
